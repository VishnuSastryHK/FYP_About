         <p>
          Today, water is considered to be one of the world’s rarest natural resources. It is essential for humans, animals, and plants. Depending on the level and quality of water, it may be a source of life and health and also a source of sickness and eventually death. Inland lakes show exceptional prominence among the clean water sources around the world. It contains more than ninety percent of all earth’s freshwater, supporting many human activities, which include agriculture, commerce, transportation, recreation, tourism, and food and energy production. They also provide important habitat for biodiversity. Thus, it is highly important to improve the pollution control of ponds and also repair the overcrowded ponds to restore their ecosystem resources as quickly as possible and contribute to the development of ecological civilization. To achieve this goal, the development and implementation of multitasking technology should be promoted. Among these technologies, Remote Sensing has attracted growing attention in the field of water quality monitoring. Individuals nowadays require something that can make their lives easier. 
         </p>
         <p>
          Water monitoring is incredibly important to keep the planet sound and rational. Many infectious diseases are contracted by water. Most freshwater bodies in nearby urban areas are being destroyed as a result of waste disposal by people or the arrival of synthetic compounds from integrated businesses. A high tank is one of the places used to store drinking water. There is a need for infinitely continuous remote monitoring of water quality parameters within such a framework. However, in many regions, the traditional approach to water quality observation depends on the collection of water for tests from different sources and subsequent investigations at research institutes are expensive, tedious, and unconventional. A consistent and effective assessment of water quality is a necessity of the hour. The increasing environmental degradation in recent years brought about by development, population growth, and climatic changes increase the need for researchers to consider its active impact on the environment, especially on water resources. Increased pollution of seawater, lakes, and rivers creates a worldwide need for more sophisticated systems for environmental monitoring, especially in the field of water quality monitoring. 
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition, developing countries like India rely on conventional methods of collecting water samples and water analysis. Due to a lack of technical knowledge and numerous early investments, water analysis is usually done through conventional processes or using portable inspectors that are not only expensive and laborious but also lack real-time data and analytics. This system is well suited to monitoring the physical and chemical properties of water in remote areas at low cost with reduced staffing. It can bring many benefits, such as efficiency and proximity to real-time data acquisition and data entry capability. Environmental monitoring has been implemented in areas such as water quality monitoring, water chemistry monitoring, hydrodynamic performance monitoring, irrigation, and agriculture. Other studies have focused on improving energy transfer, energy harvesting and management, and environmental compliance over the past few years of application. On the other hand, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, and temperature are considered normal water quality parameters and are considered to be one of the most important parameters that can be used to determine the current physicochemical state of a particular aquatic environment. The measure of how basic or acidic water is can be made by measuring the pH. pH is a significant indicator of water quality. The pH parameters are difficult to measure accurately as they work on very small amounts of ionic content, thus requiring a sensitive sensor device to be used. Temperature is a common physical test of water quality, as these parameters can affect many other factors such as photosynthesis of aquatic plants, the sensitivity of these insects to contaminants, parasites, and diseases. DO (Dissolved Oxygen) is also a parameter in monitoring water quality because of its direct impact on aquatic life. A very high or very low DO level can damage aquatic life and affect water quality.
         </p>
         <p>
          Therefore, this study will mainly focus on lake water monitoring, focusing on DO, pH, and temperature as indicators of water quality. Our aim is to improve the deployment of a water quality monitoring system to provide a possible solution in remote areas where water quality laboratories are not available. Its main advantage will be its ability to monitor in real-time. We aim to supply a system that is reproducible, expandable and can operate independently for a long time, and can be used in remote areas.
